# PacMAn

This HTML and JavaScript code creates a simple animation of Pac-Man moving horizontally within a designated "box" on a webpage. The key features of this code are:
 > It defines an HTML structure with a "box" div element where the Pac-Man animation will be displayed.
 > Two sets of Pac-Man images are stored in a two-dimensional array called arr. These images alternate to give the appearance of Pac-Man opening and closing its mouth as it moves.
 > JavaScript is used to create an img element, append it to the "box" div, and control the animation. 
 > Pac-Man's position is updated based on the direction and velocity, and the direction is reversed when Pac-Man reaches the edge of the screen.
 > The Pac-Man image is updated in the "box" div, and its position and styling are adjusted within the moving function.
 > The animation runs at a rate of 10 frames per second (100 milliseconds) using setInterval.   
In summary, this code creates a simple Pac-Man animation that moves horizontally within a defined box on the webpage, giving the illusion of Pac-Man chomping as it changes direction.
